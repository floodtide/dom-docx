# Examples

Curated HTML → DOCX demos you can open, convert, and compare without running the test harness.

Each folder contains:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `input.html` | Body fragment passed to `convertHtmlToDocx()` |
| `output.docx` | Generated Word document |
| `compare_side_by_side.png` | Chromium reference (left) vs LibreOffice-rendered DOCX (right) |

Regenerate with `npm run test:showcase`. The runner refreshes these files automatically; full harness artifacts (PDFs, diffs, scores) stay in gitignored `output/showcase/`.

## Showcases

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [quarterly-financials](./quarterly-financials/) | Condensed income statement with YoY columns and subtotals |
| [invoice](./invoice/) | Professional services invoice with logo (`logo.png` + imageResolver), line items, tax, and payment terms |
| [balance-sheet](./balance-sheet/) | Condensed balance sheet — assets, liabilities, and equity |

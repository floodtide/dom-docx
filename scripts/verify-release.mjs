 * Full pre-release / pre-tag verification gauntlet. Runs everything CI gates

 * suite. This is a LOCAL/maintainer gate, not a CI step: it needs Chromium

 *
 * Not in CI on purpose — if these could run headless in CI they'd already be in
 * guard:ci. Run from repo root before a release commit or tag: npm run verify:release
